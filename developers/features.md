# Features
The primary use-case for SGCT is to run the same graphics application on a single machine or a cluster and providing the ability to specify different projection methods for each viewport or machine. This way a cohesive cluster is constructured that is made up of individual clients, each rendering their own subset of the full image.

  - Free and open-source under MIT license on [GitHub](https://github.com/sgct/sgct)
  - Multi-computer, multi-window, and multi-viewport support
  - Frame synchronization, swap buffer synchronization (hardware) and network-based application data synchronization
  - Large variety of projection methods
    - Cubemap projection: Render 1-6 orthogonal cube faces
    - Cylindrical Projection: Projection of a 360 degree cylindrical surface
    - Equirectangular Projection: Full spherical projection displayed on a 2:1 aspect ratio image
    - Fisheye projection
    - PlanarProjection: Flat projection with controllable, potentially asymmetric field-of-view values
    - ProjectionPlane: Flat projection in which the 3D vertex coordinates of a virtual projection plane are provided
    - SphericalMirrorProjection: Projection on a spherical mirror as presented by [Paul Bourke](https://paulbourke.net/dome/)
    - TextureMappedProjection: A PlanarProjection in which a correction mesh is applied in reverse
  - Independent frame buffer resolution from window size allowing the taking of screenshots of arbitrary resolution independent of the monitor size
  - Ability to display multiple viewports per window each with their own projection method
  - Application of warping and blending meshes and black level masks
    - Support for OBJ, PFM, Scalable, SCISS, SimCad, and SkySkan meshes
  - 3D/Stereoscopic rendering
    - Active/Quadbuffer stereo
    - DLP/Checkerboard stereo
    - Line interlaced stereo
    - Anaglyph stereo (Red/Cyan, Amber/Blue)
    - Side-by-side and top-bottom
  - Statistics and performance graphs
  - Build on top of [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) with easy access to the unterlying `GLFWwindow` objects
  - Joystick and gamepad support (GLFW)
  - Anti-aliasing (MSAA and FXAA)
  - Support for Windows and Linux
  - Sharing of rendered content over the local network using the [NDI](https://ndi.video/) library
  - Sharing of rendered content to other applications using [Spout](https://spout.zeal.co/) (only on Windows)
